# MPLS Inventory management
Analyzes the IOS configuration of Cisco MPLS routers and creates an inventory with settings per router. It  includes functions to match these router settings against Service Provider inventory systems.

I use this tool to compare a network of MPLS routers with the inventory systems of Service Providers. 

Using this tool in a Service Provider environment requires to have access to the network components and inventory systems that are proprietary.

I build this software in my spare time. The documentation and API needs to be improved. If you need support in setting it up in your environment, do not hesitate to contact me.
